                    Hi everybody, my name is Davide Lionetti. In one of the many hot Italian summer days, I left my country to study abroad in order to improve my knowledge of business, international trade, management and foreign languages skills. Besides my studies, I am highly interested in entrepreneurship, web design and innovation.<br>
